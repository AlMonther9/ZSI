<h3> Overview  <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/1903/1903496.png" width=45 align=center> </h3>

This project involves the development of an environmental robot by the ZSI team. The robot is equipped with various sensors to collect environmental data, including gas, carbon monoxide, air quality, humidity, pressure, temperature, dust, GPS, ultrasonic, and gyroscope sensors. The project aims to collect environmental data for analysis using AI to make the best decisions for environmental purposes and sustainability innovations. The team is from Al-Azhar University, Faculty of Engineering, looking for sustainable solutions.
