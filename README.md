    <h1>ZSI Environmental Robot Project</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project involves the development of an environmental robot by the ZSI team. The robot is equipped with various sensors to collect environmental data, which is then sent to a server for storage and analysis.</p>

    <h2>Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Robot: The physical robot platform equipped with sensors.</li>
        <li>Sensors: Including but not limited to temperature, pressure, humidity, gas, dust, and carbon monoxide sensors.</li>
        <li>Microcontroller: ESP32 is used to gather data from the sensors.</li>
        <li>Communication: Wireless data transmission from the microcontroller to a server.</li>
        <li>Server: A server to receive, store, and process the sensor data.</li>
        <li>Database: Storage for the received sensor data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <h3>Hardware Setup:</h3>
    <p>Connect the sensors to the ESP32 microcontroller as per the provided guidelines.</p>

    <h3>Software Setup:</h3>
    <p>Upload the necessary code to the ESP32 for data collection and transmission.</p>

    <h3>Server Setup:</h3>
    <p>Set up a server to receive data from the ESP32.</p>

    <h3>Database Setup:</h3>
    <p>Install and configure a database to store the received sensor data.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Power on the environmental robot.</li>
        <li>The robot collects sensor data and transmits it to the server.</li>
        <li>The server stores the received data in the database.</li>
        <li>Analyze the data stored in the database for environmental insights.</li>
    </ol>
