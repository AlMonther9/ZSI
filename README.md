<h3> Overview </h3>
This project involves the development of an environmental robot by the ZSI team. The robot is equipped with various sensors to collect environmental data, which is then sent to a server for storage and analysis.

<h3> Components </h3>
Robot: The physical robot platform equipped with sensors.
Sensors: Including but not limited to temperature, pressure, humidity, gas, dust, and carbon monoxide sensors.
Microcontroller: ESP32 is used to gather data from the sensors.
Communication: Wireless data transmission from the microcontroller to a server.
Server: A server to receive, store, and process the sensor data.
Database: Storage for the received sensor data.
<h3> Setup </h3>
Hardware Setup: ...
Software Setup: ...
Server Setup: ...
Database Setup: ...
<h3> Usage </h3>
Power on the environmental robot.
The robot collects sensor data and transmits it to the server.
The server stores the received data in the database.
Analyze the data stored in the database for environmental insights.
